# Project ABCDE - A Big Crypto Distribution Exchange
This is the official code respository for the 'A Big Crypto Distribution Exchange' This is not a crypto exchange in a traditional sense that you buy and sell crypto but it is a Decentralized Airdrop Exchange, where you can:

1. Create your own airdrops, 
2. Apply to the airdrops.
3. Create contests or giveaways to build your community.
4. Distribute the crypto airdrop tokens.
5. Receive the crypto airdrops tokens.
...and so on!

The product will integrate features that will effectively address the concerns of the crypto community â€“ of both the project owners as well as the users.

The code respository will host the code related with all the modules of this crypto airdrop exchance. You are welcome to make pull requests, and to contribute to the project. After-all we all love crypto airdrops and we want this to a community effort! 

The product should benefit the whole community, both the airdrop distributors and the airdrop receivers. Let's collab and work toward a roaring success!
